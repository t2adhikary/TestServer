Serverless computing is becoming an increasingly popular
cloud service due to its high elasticity and fine-grain
billing. Serverless platforms like AWS Lambda, Google
Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions enable users to
quickly launch thousands of light-weight tasks, as opposed
to entire virtual machines. The number of serverless
tasks scales automatically based on application demands
and users are charged only for the resources their
tasks consume, at millisecond granularity [17, 36, 56].
While serverless platforms were originally developed
for web microservices and IoT applications, their elasticity
and billing advantages make them appealing for
data intensive applications such as interactive analytics.
Several recent frameworks launch large numbers of finegrain
tasks on serverless platforms to exploit all avaiable 
parallelism in an analytics job and achieve near realtime
performance [32, 45, 27]. In contrast to traditional
serverless applications that consist of a single function
executed when a new request arrives, analytics jobs typically
consist of multiple stages and require sharing of
state and data across stages of tasks (e.g., data shuffling).
